=head1 NAME

MooX::Failover - Instantiate Moo classes with failover

=head1 VERSION

v0.2.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # In your class:

  package MyClass;

  use Moo;
  use MooX::Failover;

  has 'attr' => ( ... );

  # after attributes are defined:

  failover_to 'OtherClass';

  ...

  # When using the class

  my $obj = MyClass->new( %args );

  # If %args contains missing or invalid values or new otherwise
  # fails, then $obj will be of type "OtherClass".

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides constructor failover for L<Moo> classes.

For example, if a class cannot be instantiated because of invalid arguments
(perhaps from an untrusted source), then instead it returns the
failover class (passing the same arguments to that class).

It is roughly equivalent to using

  my $obj = eval { MyClass->new(%args) //
     OtherClass->new( %args, error => $@ );

This allows for cleaner design, by not forcing you to duplicate type
checking for constructor parameters.

A use case for this module is for instantiating
L<Web::Machine::Resource> objects, where a resource class's attributes
correspond to URL arguments.  A type failure would normally cause an
internal serror error (HTTP 500).  Using L<MooX::Failover>, we can
return a different resource object that examines the error, and
returns a more appropriate error code, e.g. bad request (HTTP 400).

See the module documentation for L<MooX::Failover> for more information.
